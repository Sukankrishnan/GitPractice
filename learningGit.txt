How to add collaborators to your git repo?
Go to Settings -> Collaborators -> Add people to contribute


git push
fatal: The upstream branch of your current branch does not match
the name of your current branch.  To push to the upstream branch
on the remote, use

    git push origin HEAD:master

To push to the branch of the same name on the remote, use

    git push origin HEAD

To choose either option permanently, see push.default in 'git help config'.

To avoid automatically configuring an upstream branch when its name
won't match the local branch, see option 'simple' of branch.autoSetupMerge
in 'git help config'.

git getch
---------
It helps to know the changes made in the remote repository. But it does not make any changes to the working directory.
